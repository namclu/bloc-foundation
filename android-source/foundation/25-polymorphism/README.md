## Polymorphism

>This assignment compiles and runs without additional work. However, the assignment requires you to [refactor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) the existing code to use the principles introduced in its respective checkpoint.

Open your command prompt and `cd` into this README's directory (`foundation/25-polymorphism`). Edit `Main.java` and re-do the work indicated using polymorphism.

After you've finished, compile your code by running the following command:

```bash
$ javac -d bin src/com/bloc/polymorph/*.java src/com/bloc/polymorph/pets/*.java
```

After it compiles successfully, `cd` into the bin directory:

```bash
$ cd bin/
```

From within bin, execute your code by running the following command:

```bash
$ java -ea com.bloc.polymorph.Main
```

If you see a nice congrats message, you've successfully poly-morphed!
