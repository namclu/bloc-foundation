## Operations

Open your command prompt and `cd` into this README's directory (`foundation/15-operations`). In the src path is a file named `Operations.java`. Open it and fill in the portions of the code where the comments have indicated.

When you've completed your work, test your code by compiling it with the following command:

```bash
$ javac -d bin/ src/com/bloc/ops/Operations.java
```

Correct any and all errors that appear.

After it returns successfully, `cd` into the bin directory:

```bash
$ cd bin/
```

From within bin, run the following command:

```bash
$ java com.bloc.ops.Operations
```

If you see a success message, you've rocked it!
