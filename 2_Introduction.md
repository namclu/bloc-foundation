#2 Introduction: What to Expect

1. Pocket Cast - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts
  * I love listening to pocketcasts and use this app daily. Very well thought-out and makes good use of Material Design. Episodes are easy to find, the animation used during transitions are quite slick, and it provides the show notes and links.
2. Todoist - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.todoist
  * I use this app to keep on track and organized in my learning. It's so simple and intuitive that it's hard to believe it's a mobile app.
3. FreshBooks - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.freshbooks.android
  * I haven't used this app before but some of the features it uses interests me for an app I'd like to develop.
4. Yelp - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yelp.android
  * Again, this app is similiar to another app I'd like to develop. I use it regularly to find good restaurants and other businesses. What I like most about the app is that content is user generated.
