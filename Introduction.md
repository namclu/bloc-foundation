#Introduction

##Bio
I chose to enroll in the **Bloc.io** *Android Development* program because I was attracted to the mentorship aspect and flexible schedule that the program offered. Learning software development is quite a difficult process so having a mentor available will make learning much quicker. Prior to Bloc, I was learning Android on my own using resources such as:
* Udacity
* developer.android.com
* Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide 2nd Ed

##Goals
My goals for the Android Development program include:
- [ ] Create a robust Android application and uploading it to the Play Store
- [ ] Use Android services and APIs
- [ ] Debug, understand error messages, and fix my programs
